        "\n",
        "As you have probably already experienced, writing code invloved making many many tiny changes over time, testing out different ideas and doing little checks to see how things work. Often, you will want to go back to a version of your code that you wrote before you made some change that didn't work. We've seen that it is quite easy to make a mistake with your code, or that it is quite easy to break your code. When you start writing longer pieces of code, this becomes more of a problem as there is much more code to wade through to find and trace the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution to this problem is to regularly track your changes. We've seen that code can be written in all sorts of places, we have been using jupyter notebooks on colab, but the same code could be run from a text file on a local machine. We therefore can't rely on a track changes function bespoke to a piece of software like in word documents. We need somewhere to save versions of our code with annotations. We do this using software called Git.\n",

        "\n",
        "### What is Git?\n",
        "\n",
        "Git is a version control system- a tool that helps you keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others. Think of it like the version history in Word or Google Docs, but much more powerful. With Git, every change you make to a file can be saved with a commit message (a note describing what you changed). You can then go back to any previous version of your project if something breaks, or see exactly who changed what and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is Git Important for Engineers?\n",
        "\n",
        "In civil engineering projects, we never just have one drawing or one report — we have revisions, updates, and collaboration between many people. Git provides the same for coding projects. Instead of naming files `beam_analysis_v3_FINAL_revised2.py`, Git keeps a clean history of changes inside the project itself. This makes your work:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Safer → you can always recover an older version.\n",
        "* Collaborative → multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other.\n",
        "* Documented → changes are recorded with dates and explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Git vs GitHub\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s important to distinguish between Git and GitHub:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Git is the tool on your computer that manages version history.\n",
        "* GitHub is an online platform that stores Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy to share your work and collaborate with others.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub makes it much easier to work in teams and to showcase your projects publicly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Concepts in Git\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Repository (repo):** The project folder that Git is tracking.\n",
        "* **Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a specific moment, with a message describing the change made to the previous version.\n",
        "* **Branch:** A separate line of development, useful when testing new ideas without disturbing the main project.\n",
        "* **Merge:** Bringing changes from one branch back into another.\n",
        "* **Remote:** A version of your repository hosted online (e.g., on GitHub).\n",
        "\n",
        "Git is like an engineer’s lab book for coding projects. Every calculation, assumption, and change is stored, so the work can be trusted, checked, and reused.\n",

        "\n",
        "Open source software is software whose source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share. This is very common in engineering and science: many of the tools we use daily (NumPy, Pandas, OpenSees for structural analysis, QGIS for mapping) are open source. The open source model encourages transparency, collaboration, and innovation, since engineers and researchers worldwide can improve the code, fix errors, and adapt it for their own projects. For civil engineers, this means you don’t always need expensive licenses — you can access powerful tools, learn from the code, and even contribute improvements back to the community.\n",

        "\n",
        "GitHub is the most widely used platform for sharing code. It allows you to keep your projects under version control (using Git), track changes, and collaborate with others. Sharing code on GitHub is a great way to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Document your work like an engineer’s lab book, with a clear history of changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Make your assignments, analysis scripts, or design tools visible to others (classmates, future employers, or collaborators).\n",

        "\n",
        "FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. These principles were originally developed for research data, but they apply equally well to code:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Findable → Your code should be easy to discover (e.g., hosted on GitHub with clear repository names and keywords).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Accessible → Others should be able to access the code (e.g., a public repository with open licensing).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interoperable → Code should use standard formats, libraries, and clear documentation so others can integrate it into their own workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reusable → Your code should be well-documented, licensed, and tested so that others can reuse it confidently in new projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following the FAIR principles, you ensure that your computational tools are not just one-off scripts for an assignment, but part of a larger ecosystem of reproducible and shareable knowledge."
